# WheatStoneBridgeCalculator

# User Guide
1. About
The Wheatstone bridge calculator is a simple but powerful tool that allows you to calculate the unknown resistor in the circuit. It also briefly explains the concepts and theory behind it to help you get your head around the problem. This program can be used for any Wheatstone bridge and it can help anyone having difficulties with the material.

2. 	Download
Before opening the application you need to install a 2.7 IDE for python. We recommend IDLE, as it is coded in 100% pure Python, using the tkinter GUI toolkit and is cross-platform, so it works mostly the same on Windows, Unix, and Mac OS X.
3. 	IDLE

IDLE can be downloaded here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
To download it, just click on “Download Python 2.7.11” and once its done, install it using onscreen instructions.

4. 	Installation
Once you have the python IDE, you need to download and save the Test.py file to your computer. Once you have done that you can open the file with IDLE.

5. 	Opening
To open the application right-click the Test.py file and choose open with and then select “IDLE 2.7”. You will see a window with python code inside.

6. 	Running
Once you have opened the file you need to run it. To do that you either have to navigate to “Run” and then choose “Run Python Shell” or click F5 on your keyboard. If you do that another window will pop up with the working program
7. 	Using
Once you have opened the program in the Python shell you can start using the application. Using it is straightforward. All you need to do is enter the values for the resistors and choose the sizes for the resistors and then click calculate.
8. 	Errors
After you click calculate it will give you the answer below. However if you entered letter or other character the program will give an error saying to change your input. To do that you can just delete the wrong value replace it with another value and then calculate the answer again.
